# Project 3: BudgetBuddy 📊

Welcome to BudgetBuddy! 

 If you're using multiple bank accounts, credit cards, or investment accounts, that's where BudgetBuddy comes in handy. Our app centralizes all your financial information in one secure location, making it easier to visualize their financial progress over time.
Our app also offers features for setting savings goals, and generating reports to gain insights into your financial health. 


## Requirements for Project 🏗
- Be a full-stack MERN application.

- Authenticate users using JWT.
- Implement authorization by restricting access to the Creation, Updating & Deletion of data resources
- Be styled such that the app looks and feels similar to apps we use on a daily basis - in other words, it should have a consistent and polished user interface.
